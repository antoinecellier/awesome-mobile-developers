# Contributing

Your contributions are always welcome!

## Guideline

* Add one developer per Pull Request.
    * Make sure the PR title is in the format of `[section-name] developper-fullname` (e.g. [iOS] David Smith) .
    * Write down the reason why this developer is awesome.
* Add the section:
  `Flutter | React Native | Android | iOS`

  You can propose a new section

* Add the link: 

   `[developper-fullname](https://github.com/GITHUB-USERNAME) [![GitHub followers](https://img.shields.io/github/followers/GITHUB-USERNAME.svg?style=social&label=Follow&maxAge=2592000)](https://github.com/GITHUB-USERNAME) [![Twitter followers](https://badgen.net/twitter/follow/TWITTER-USERNAME?icon=twitter&label)](https://twitter.com/TWITTER-USERNAME)`
 
  For example for David Smith:

  Replace **GITHUB-USERNAME** by `UnderscoreDavidSmith`

  Replace **TWITTER-USERNAME** by `_DavidSmith`
  
  
* Search previous Pull Requests or Issues before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.

Just a gentle reminder: **Try not to submit yourself. Instead, wait until someone finds it necessary to do it for you :)**
